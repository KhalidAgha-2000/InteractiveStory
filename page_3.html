        <p>He ran away and headed towards a neearby city where he met another robot named E.1.3 that was set to being destroyed but managed to escape.</p>
        <p>E.1.3 Had a flow with its battery so K.2.1.1 gave it the battery that he found earlier. They kept running from town to town until they decided to stop running and live in a town.</p>
        <p>They entered the city with a chip that t K.2.1.1 stole from the military camp, he thought that may be useful for him later , but  it turns out it turns any robot into a war machine.</p>
        <p>The guards started hunting  him to retrieve that chip and looked for them through the city until they found them .</p>
        <p>The army members and the robots had a fight over that chip, a fight which was easily won by the army members because there was several of them , the 1st Lieutenant came up with an evil plan :</p>
        <p>“ Let's install the chip  into the robot's system and use them to help us.” </p>
        <p>The IT manager has activated K.2.1.1 and E.1.3 as war robots.</p>
        <p>After that the guards and the two robots entered a fight with some enemies. The fight  lasted for two days.</p>
